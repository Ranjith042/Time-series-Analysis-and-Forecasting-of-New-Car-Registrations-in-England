# Time-series-analysis-and-forecasting

###  Presenting two time series forecasting projects I recently completed using R statistical software. 

Project 1: 
constructed an optimal AR(2) model to analyze daily on-road NOx sensor measurements, enabling data-driven air quality policy recommendations. Rigorous model validation affirmed accuracy in capturing historical emissions patterns.

Project 2:
produced a robust ARIMA forecasting engine for quarterly automobile registrations in England, empowering manufacturers to align inventory and production strategies with predicted consumer demand changes. 

Through developing customized summaries for stakeholders, I refined skills in translating complex technical details into essential insights for decision making, aimed at conveying core takeaways to diverse audiences. 

I also demonstrated proficiency in core time series analysis techniques like:
 ‣ Testing and adjusting for stationarity,
 ‣ Decomposing seasonal and trend components,
 ‣ Analyzing ACF and PACF structures,
 ‣ Iteratively selecting optimal ARIMA models,
 ‣ Statistical and graphical diagnostic validation,
 ‣ Multi-step forecasting,
